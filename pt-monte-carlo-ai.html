                <br>
                <p>
                    In early 2024, I made a Monte Carlo Tic-Tac-Toe Player is a Python program designed to simulate and optimize 
                    decision-making in Tic-Tac-Toe using the Monte Carlo method. The program begins by defining key constants such as 
                    NTRIALS, MCMATCH, and MCOTHER, which control the number of simulated games (trials) and the scoring weights for the 
                    machine player and the opponent. The core of the program revolves around several functions that work together to 
                    determine the best move for the machine player.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The mc_trial function is responsible for simulating a complete game of Tic-Tac-Toe from the current board state. 
                    Starting with the current player, it randomly selects and occupies empty squares on the board until the game 
                    concludes with either a win, loss, or draw. This function uses a loop to continually check the board's status, 
                    alternating between players after each move using the switch_player method provided by the Tic-Tac-Toe module.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Once a trial game is completed, the mc_update_scores function evaluates the outcome and adjusts the scores on the 
                    board accordingly. This function iterates through each square on the board, comparing the square's occupant with 
                    the game's winner. If the machine player wins, squares occupied by the machine player receive a positive score 
                    increment (determined by MCMATCH), while squares occupied by the opponent receive a negative adjustment. 
                    Conversely, if the opponent wins, the scoring is reversed, penalizing the machine player's squares while 
                    rewarding the opponent's. In the case of a draw, no changes are made to the scores.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The get_best_move function then takes the updated scores matrix and identifies the square with the highest score 
                    among those still available (i.e., empty squares). The function begins by initializing max_score to negative 
                    infinity to ensure any valid score encountered during iteration will be higher. As the function evaluates each 
                    square, it updates max_score and records the corresponding square as the current best move. If multiple squares 
                    have the same maximum score, the function randomly selects one, introducing an element of unpredictability into 
                    the machine player's strategy.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The mc_move function brings everything together by orchestrating the decision-making process for the machine 
                    player. It initializes a scores matrix with all elements set to zero, representing the Tic-Tac-Toe board. 
                    The function then runs a specified number of trials (NTRIALS), during each of which it clones the current board, 
                    plays out a trial game using mc_trial, and updates the scores based on the game's outcome with mc_update_scores. 
                    After all trials are complete, the function calls get_best_move to select the optimal move for the machine player, 
                    which is then returned as the final decision.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    To test and observe the machine player's performance, the program provides options to run the game either through a 
                    console-based interface or a graphical user interface (GUI). These testing methods allow users to witness how the 
                    Monte Carlo method enables the machine player to adapt and improve its strategy through numerous simulated games, 
                    ultimately making more informed decisions that increase its chances of winning or forcing a draw. The Monte Carlo 
                    Tic-Tac-Toe Player exemplifies how probabilistic simulations can be leveraged to enhance decision-making in games, 
                    creating a robust and competitive artificial intelligence that can challenge human players. More details of my project 
                    can be seen in the blog and the code can be downloaded below.
