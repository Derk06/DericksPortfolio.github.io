                <p>
                    In early 2024, I was given a task where I had to represent the spliting process of a merge sort algorithim in a tree 
                    diagram. It seemed fairly easy but this task too one week to complete. The input data for this project was 
                    [12, 8, 2, 17, 5, 10, 96, 4, 1, 100, 14]. Initially, the task presented several challenges. The main challenge 
                    was to accurately capture and display the process of dividing the list into sublists at each iteration. My approach 
                    involved implementing the merge sort algorithm with a specific focus on tracking how the list was divided into left 
                    and right sublists. To achieve this, I used two lists, tree_listleft and tree_listright, to record the elements 
                    that were split into left and right branches.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The mergeSort function played a central role in this project. It recursively divides the array into halves, and 
                    during each recursive call, I recorded which elements were allocated to the left and right sublists. This tracking 
                    allowed me to understand and document the flow of data as it moved through the algorithm. For instance, in the 
                    first split, the input list [12, 8, 2, 17, 5, 10, 96, 4, 1, 100, 14] was divided into [12, 8, 2, 17, 5] which 
                    was recorded in tree_listleft as it was split into the left branch and [10, 96, 4, 1, 100, 14] which was recorded 
                    in tree_listright as it was split into the right branch.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The challenge was to figure out which elements from tree_listleft and tree list right fit together as both lists 
                    only showed the number that was split into either right or left branches. So putting them back together to the original list 
                    was a challenge.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The visualization was created using the ArithmeticExpression class and the draw_tree module. These tools allowed 
                    me to render the binary tree diagram that displayed how the original list was split at each stage of the merge 
                    sort algorithm. The tree started with the full list at the root and branched out to show the progressively smaller 
                    sublists down to individual elements. This visual approach made it easier to grasp how merge sort systematically 
                    breaks down the problem into manageable pieces before tackling the more straightforward task of merging the sorted 
                    sublists.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In the end, the project was a success. The final tree diagram effectively demonstrated how merge sort divides a 
                    list into smaller and smaller parts. More details of the project can be viewed in my blog and my code can be downloaded 
                    below.
