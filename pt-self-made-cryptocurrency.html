                <p>
                    In early 2021, me and my friend wanted to build a cryptocurrency as a fun summer project, my part of the project 
                    was the creation of the Genesis Block, the foundational block of the blockchain. I then implemented the mining 
                    process, utilizing the SHA256 hash function to ensure the security and integrity of the blocks. Each block was 
                    rigorously tested to confirm the correct implementation of the cryptographic functions.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Building on this foundation, I developed the Blockchain class, which allowed for the creation, validation, and 
                    management of a chain of blocks. I focused on multiple chain validation techniques to ensure that the blockchain 
                    could be correctly validated and updated across different nodes. This included implementing and testing mechanisms 
                    to replace a blockchain with a longer, valid chain, ensuring the integrity and continuity of the blockchain.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I organized the project into modular components, including the creation of an API that could handle requests to 
                    get blocks and mine new blocks. To enable peer-to-peer communication, I developed a WebSocket server, allowing 
                    different blockchain peers to connect, exchange messages, and synchronize their blockchains. This synchronization 
                    was essential for maintaining a consistent and accurate blockchain across all participating nodes, especially when 
                    handling challenges like the 51% attack.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    To add the cryptocurrency functionality, I integrated the Proof of Work system, including dynamic block difficulty 
                    adjustment and nonce calculation to secure the network against malicious attacks. I implemented a wallet system 
                    where users could generate cryptographic keys, create transactions, and sign them securely. The transaction 
                    handling extended to a transaction pool, which was integrated into the peer-to-peer server to manage transactions 
                    across the network. I also included a miner class responsible for validating transactions and issuing rewards, 
                    ensuring that miners were incentivized to maintain the blockchain.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The project became a fully functional cryptocurrency system, where I implemented features like wallet balance 
                    calculation during transactions, transaction validation, and broadcasting cleared transactions across the network. 
                    Finally, I tested the entire system to ensure that all components worked together seamlessly, resulting in a robust 
                    and secure blockchain with a functioning cryptocurrency. Unfortunately, most of the code has been long lost as my laptop 
                    hardrive broke and could never retrieve the project but was able to salvage a few snippits of code.
