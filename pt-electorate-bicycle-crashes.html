                <p>
                    In year 10, I was tasked by my I.T teacher to take a random dataset from ACT Open Data Portal and analyse and manipulate 
                    the data how I see fit. So I decided to take a bicycle crash dataset from the portal where it shows all the bicycle 
                    crashes that have happened in canberra over the past 10 years. I decided that I would try and find which 
                    political / electorate district had the most bicycle crashes. This seemed like an easy task until I realised that 
                    the location of the bicycle crashes only shows what street it happened on. Meaning I had to make a dataset where 
                    I take every single street in Canberra, and organize them into their respective suburbs, on top of that the 
                    location of where the crash happened not only showed the street but also the intersection like this 
                    (street/intersection).
                </p>
                <br>
                <p> Since I only needed the street I had to do a lot of data cleaning, this was 
                    very tough as I couldn't just take values before the "/" because sometimes the street and intersection would be
                    reversed like this (intersection/street), so I had to figure which was the actual street between the two. After I did that I 
                    had to label each suburb into their respective political / electorate district. After 2 weeks of making and 
                    cleaning the dataset I was finally able to sort each bicycle crash into their respective political / electorate 
                    district. I then graphed the data to figure out which electorate / political district had the most bicycle crashes which 
                    came out to be kurrajong. I then was tasked to put the values I gathered into a map. I first got the longitiude and latitude of 
                    where each crash happend and then plotted them onto a 2D map of Canberra. More details of my work can be downloaded below.</p>
