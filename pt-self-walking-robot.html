                <p>
                    I began my project at the start of 2024, where I decided I wanted to make a reinforcement learning system. I decided 
                    I wanted to make a robot that can walk by itself using reinforcement learning. However, I first needed to learn how 
                    reinforcement learning works so for the next 4 months, I began researching on reinforcement learning. In the first month 
                    I began looking for learning resources but most of the sources I couldn't understand because it required university level maths 
                    which I didn't understand because I haven't learnt it yet in school. However I was able to find a book on reinforcement learning 
                    where it explains RL concepts in detail and shows how to implement them in python. I spent another 3 months going through all 500 pages 
                    of the book. Once I learned the RL concepts in the book I began my search for which algorithim I should use for my robot. I came to 
                    the conclusion that I should use the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithim for my robot as one the algorithim 
                    excels at using continuous actions where the actions you can take in an environment can go up to infinity. I then began experimenting with 
                    the algorithim getting comfortable with it and understanding it on a deep level, like using the algorithim to beat the OpenAI Bipedal-Walker-V3 
                    environment and it was successful. In under 800 episodes, the agent was able to learn how to run. My experiments can be seen on my Colab Notebook below.

                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    After learning how to use the TD3 algorithim, I began creating a 3D model for my robot. My first design had a few flaws to it, so 
                    I made a completely new design and printed it out. I then began working on the electrical side of the project, where I 
                    had two lipo batteries and I planned on using both at the same time because training a robot in a 3 dimensional environment,
                    will take a very long time to train meaning I will need a very long battery life for the robot. So since I had two lipo batteries, one 11.1V and one 12V. I 
                    thought I could combine their power so power the robot, but both batteries were at different voltages meaning I can't just plug then 
                    together in one outlet or they will destroy both batteries. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    So to counter act this I came up with the idea of using two diodes which will be connected to one outlet, since diodes only allow current to
                    flow to which ever diode has the highest voltage. Meaning that in the beginning the 12V battery will be the only battery that can 
                    send current to the robot but when the battery is dead the voltage drops which allows the second diode connected to the 11.1V battery to power 
                    the robot. However, I bought the wrong diodes so that idea was a bust. Then I thought of using a circuit called a 
                    voltage divider where you can figure out the voltage of a battery based on the two resistors that are hooked up to it. So using 
                    this circuit I used the two resistors to step down the voltage from 12V to 5V so the signal can be read by the Arduino and 
                    then by reversing the calculations of the voltage divider circuit, the Aruino can figure out what voltage the battery is at. If the 
                    battery is below 6V which is mandatory to run the servos and raspberry pi, then it uses a relay that instantly switches to the other battery.
                    When the first battery has power again, the Arduino sees that the first batttery is now above 6V and uses a relay to switch to the first battery.

                    More updates will come soon! If you want to keep up with the development of the robot, you can check my blog where I go 
                    into detail about my designs and code.
