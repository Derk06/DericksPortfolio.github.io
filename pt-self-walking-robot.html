                <p>
                    I began my project at the start of 2024, where I decided I wanted to make a reinforcement learning system for a school project. I decided 
                    I wanted to make a robot that can walk by itself using reinforcement learning. However, I first needed to learn how 
                    reinforcement learning works so for the next 4 months, I began researching reinforcement learning. In the first month 
                    I began looking for learning resources but most of the sources I couldn't understand because it required university level maths 
                    which I didn't understand because I haven't learnt it yet in school. However I was able to find a book on reinforcement learning 
                    where it explains RL concepts in detail and shows how to implement them in python. I spent another 3 months going through all 500 pages 
                    of the book. Once I learned the RL concepts in the book I began my search for which algorithim I should use for my robot. I came to 
                    the conclusion that I should use the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithim for my robot as one, the algorithim 
                    excels at using continuous actions where the actions you can take in an environment can go up to infinity. I then began experimenting with 
                    the algorithim getting comfortable with it and understanding it on a deep level, like using the algorithim to beat the OpenAI Bipedal-Walker-V3 
                    environment and it was successful. In under 800 episodes, the agent was able to learn how to run. My experiments can be seen on my Colab Notebook below.

                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    After learning how to use the TD3 algorithim, I began creating a 3D model for my robot. My first design had a few flaws to it, so 
                    I made a completely new design and printed it out. I then began working on the electrical side of the project, where I 
                    had two lipo batteries and I planned on using both at the same time because training a robot in a 3 dimensional environment,
                    will take a very long time to train meaning I will need a very long battery life for the robot. So since I had two lipo batteries, one 11.1V and one 12V. I 
                    thought I could combine their power to power the robot, but both batteries were at different voltages meaning I can't just plug then 
                    together in one outlet or it will destroy both batteries. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    So to counter act this I came up with the idea of using two diodes which will be connected to one outlet, since diodes only allow current to
                    flow to which ever diode has the highest voltage. Meaning that in the beginning the 12V battery will be the only battery that can 
                    send current to the robot but when the battery is dead the voltage drops which allows the second diode connected to the 11.1V battery to power 
                    the robot. However, I bought the wrong diodes so that idea was a bust. Then I thought of using a circuit called a 
                    voltage divider where you can figure out the voltage of a battery based on the two resistors that are hooked up to it. So using 
                    this circuit I used the two resistors to step down the voltage from 12V to 5V so the signal can be read by the Arduino and 
                    then by reversing the calculations of the voltage divider circuit, the Aruino can figure out what voltage the battery is at. If the 
                    battery is below 6V which is mandatory to run the servos and raspberry pi, then it uses a relay that instantly switches to the other battery.
                    When the first battery has power again, the Arduino sees that the first batttery is now above 6V and uses a relay to switch to the first battery. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    After my battery backup system was a success, I connected it to two buck converters to create a multi-stage power delivery system. First, the 
                    power was fed into the primary buck converter, which stepped the voltage down from 12V to 6.5V. This adjustment was necessary because the servos 
                    in my robot had an operating voltage range of 6V to 7V, and 6.5V was optimal for their performance. From there, I connected the output of the first 
                    buck converter to a second one, which stepped the voltage down further, from 6.5V to 5V. This final step was critical to power the Raspberry Pi, as 
                    it requires a stable 5V input to function properly.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    However, the process was not without its challenges. One of the major difficulties I faced was dealing with the wiring. Initially, I used thin wires for the 
                    connections, not realizing that their higher resistance would limit the current flow. This stopped my Raspberry Pi from booting up since the Raspberry Pi needed atleast 2A,
                    and the thin wires could only really handle around 1A. This resulted in significant voltage drops and overheating, even causing 
                    the insulation of the wires to melt. When I replaced the thin wires with thicker ones capable of handling higher currents, the system stabilized, and the components began 
                    functioning correctly. This experience taught me the importance of wire gauge selection in high-current applications.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    After booting up the Raspberry Pi, I started coding the TD3 algorithim, I repurposed the algorithim I used for the 
                    Open AI Bipedal Walker environemnt, and converted it so it can be used by my robot. After repurposing the algorithim, I 
                    began setting up my environment so the algorithim can learn. I began by setting up the pressure plates for the feet of my robot, these pressure 
                    plates help the robot learn where its feet are positioned and lets it know its on the ground, the pressure plates are just two metal plates and when they touch 
                    they make a closed circuit. I hooked the pressure plate to an Arduino and coded it so it would act as a button which would return either true or false. On the same Arduino, 
                    I connected 10 servos on to it, these servos act as joints for the legs of my robot, this would allow it to move. I also set up a USB camera and connected it to the Raspberry PI, 
                    this camera used computer vision to find out where a human face is and then calculate how far it is using focal length math, this was used in the learning of the TD3 algorithim as 
                    I was making my robot learn how to walk towards a human.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I then setup a second Arduino which is connected to an MPU6050, this would give my robot it's orientation data and help the robot learn how 
                    to balance itself. I then connected both Arduino's to the Raspberry Pi and used serial communication so that the data can be sent from the Arduino's to 
                    the Raspberry Pi. After I set up serial communication, I grabbed the data from the Arduino's and made a function where it grabs the data and put them 
                    into a tensor which my TD3 algorithim can use and learn from. The TD3 algorithim would then output an action list containing 10 values. I would then use 
                    serial communication again by sending the list of actions to the first Arduino which I connected my 10 servos too. After I sent the action list to the Arduino, I would 
                    do some data processing and send each of the 10 actions in the list to the servos. After I finished the build of my robot, I built a training rig out of pvc pipes
                    for the robot to train in. This helped the robot learn how to balance and protect it in training. I also used an ATX power supply that I found at the dump 
                    to power on my robot, since I didn't really need to use battery power when in training. So I repurposed an old ATX power supply from a PC tower to power on my robot during
                    training. After powering it on and doing some testing, my robot showcased that it was learning and could potentially learn how to walk. However, this robot is only a prototype meaning 
                    the design isn't perfect and a lot of imrpovements can be made, in the future I will be making some adjustments to the design like adding a torso with arms so that it can learn to pick itself up. 
                    My design was also rushed and didn't have a lot of budget to work with, since it was a school project.
                    However, this whole project was a success since I was only testing to see if the system would learn by itself rather than it fully walking.

                    I was also able to showcase this project at PYCON AU which is the largest annual convention for the discussion and promotion of the Python programming language.
                    I showcased this project along with 2 other people who had their own seperate projects and all of us combined them into one big project, our talk can be viewed on the PYCON AU youtube channel.
